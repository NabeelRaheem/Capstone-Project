In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of INVISTA's supply chain, focusing on the pressing issue of material delivery delays affecting 40% of deliveries. The approach involved harnessing industry trends, improving data quality, and employing classification algorithms to predict and mitigate late deliveries. After meticulous data cleaning and validation of a dataset spanning from 2018 to 2023, key features such as Company Code ID, Postal Code, Vendor ID, Sub commodity, and Plant ID were strategically utilized for feature engineering. Employing a time series split, I applied various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Extreme Gradient Boosting, to predict late deliveries. The models were evaluated using metrics like odds ratio F1 score, Accuracy, precision, and recall, with data imbalances addressed through SMOTE to enhance model robustness.

The results not only highlighted the Extreme Gradient Boosting model as the more effective choice but also identified specific Vendor IDs, US postal codes, and Plant IDs correlated with heightened risks of late deliveries. This insight allows INVISTA to proactively manage orders with identified risk factors, optimizing the supply chain's responsiveness and reliability. The real impact of these findings lies in potential cost savings for the company. By strategically addressing late deliveries associated with specific vendors and locations, INVISTA can minimize disruptions and associated expenses. Proactive management of orders linked to high-risk factors ensures efficient resource allocation, reduces production downtime, and ultimately leads to significant cost savings. The project's data-driven insights empower INVISTA to make informed decisions, not only improving operational efficiency but also directly contributing to the company's financial health.
